# Dalle_2.0

This is a Dall-E clone that accepts the prompt given by the user and returns an image based on that prompt. Users can also share the image with the community and can also see what other people shared in the community with the prompt and their names written at the bottom. Users can also download the image in 1024*1024 size.

## Installation

Clone the project into your local directory. For setting up the front end, head to the client folder

```bash
  cd client
```
Install the necessary dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```
Start the deployment server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Now we need to set the backend as well to make our project work. Before we do that, please set up the environment variables for openAI API, MongoDB as well as Cloudinary in the .env file. Without that, the project won't work

For setting up the backend, head to the server folder

```bash
  cd server
```
Execute the startup script by

```bash
  npm start
```
